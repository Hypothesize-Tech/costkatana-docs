## Troubleshooting

### My usage data isn't showing up
**Common solutions:**
1. **Check API key permissions** - ensure write access is enabled
2. **Verify integration** - confirm tracking code is properly implemented
3. **Wait for processing** - data appears within 1-2 minutes
4. **Check filters** - ensure dashboard filters aren't hiding data

### I'm not receiving optimization tips
**Possible causes:**
1. **Insufficient data** - need 5-10 requests to generate personalized tips
2. **Notification settings** - check your alert preferences
3. **Already optimized** - you might already be using best practices!
4. **Profile building** - our AI needs time to learn your patterns

### API requests are failing
**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Check API key format** - should start with `ck_user_` or `ck_test_`
2. **Verify endpoints** - ensure using correct base URL
3. **Rate limits** - check if you've exceeded your plan limits
4. **Service status** - visit [status.costkatana.com](https://status.costkatana.com)
